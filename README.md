Steps to follow

● Mention the date in the csv file on which date you want to take the attendance.
● Run the semproj6.py file in terminal (python3 semproj6.py)


Project structure:

Project contains 2 python files: semproj6.py and csvMainipulator.py.
We do detection, recognition and registration in semproj6.py file.
Whereas, using csvMainipulator.py file we mark the attendance.
If we want to register a new student, we simply just need to put the image of that
student in the directory.
